Conventions to follow when creating new lambdas.

Some quick conventions to keep in mind when creating & naming new lambdas

Lambdas should be named handler.ts within their dedicated directories
Lambda directories should follow {trigger}.{operationName} naming scheme where:
Trigger refers to one of: http, sqs etc.
Operation id: should refer to name of the handler, in case of OpenAPI request handling, it should match the definition outlined in the specification (docs dir in the root of this repository)
Lambda class names should match the operation name
Plurality is important (i.e. GetItems vs GetItem) should be relevant to input/output types.
